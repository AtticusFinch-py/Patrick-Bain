About Me

  Hello! I'm an experienced logistics professional and a proud US Army veteran, having served in Afghanistan. My journey has been diverse and enriching, starting with an undergraduate degree in Bible and Theology with a technology minor. This unique blend of studies has instilled strong Christian values, especially in data privacy and ethics â€“ principles I actively implement in my professional life.
  I'm pursuing a Masters of Science in Business Analytics and recently graduated from the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. With 9 years in transportation and logistics, I've developed expert-level problem-solving skills, adeptly navigating complex challenges. However, my interests expand beyond logistics, and I am open to new industries. I am passionate about applying analytics and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

Fun Facts
  Sports Enthusiast: I'm a big fan of the NFL, NBA, and Golf. Watching games and analyzing player statistics is something I thoroughly enjoy.
  Favorite Quote: "The satisfaction you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding." This encapsulates my belief that while good intentions are important, they alone are not sufficient. It underscores the idea that success often lies in tackling the tasks we tend to    avoid, acknowledging that while many of us know what it takes to achieve our goals, the real challenge lies in the action we must take to realize them.

Professional Goals
  I am eager to participate in outsourcing projects where I can use my skill set to contribute meaningfully. While my background is in logistics, I am open to exploring opportunities in different sectors where I can apply my analytical skills.
